            <b>Abstract.</b>
            Tokenising continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens and modelling them with language models (LMs)
            have achieved a success for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Although these models can generate speech with
            high
            quality and naturalness, their synthesised samples can still suffer from artifacts, mispronunciation, word
            repeating,
            etc. In this paper, we argue these undesirable properties could partly be caused by the randomness of
            sampling-based
            strategies during the autoregressive decoding of LMs. Therefore, we look at maximisation-based decoding
            approaches
            and propose Temporal Repetition Aware Diverse Beam Search (TRAD-BS) to find the most probable sequences of
            the generated
            speech tokens. Experiments with two most recent LM-based TTS models show that the proposed
            maximisation-based decoding
            strategy can generate speech with fewer mispronunciation and better speaker consistency.

            (a) A general inference paradigm of LM-based TTS. Speech tokens are generated autoregressively before
            converted
            into speech. (b) TRAD-BS operates through both decoding steps and beams, adding temporal and beam-wise
            penalties
            to repeated tokens. This can also be applied to the case where multiple tokens need to be decoded at a
            single step.
